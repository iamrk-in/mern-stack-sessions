-> What is an ExpressJS?
    - An ExpressJS is a web application framework for NodeJs.
    - It provides various features that make web application development fast
    - ExpressJS is based on the NodeJs middleware module called 'connect' which in turn uses the 'http' module.

-> Features of ExpressJS:
    1. Makes NodeJs web application development fast and easy
    2. Easy to configure and customize
    3. Allows you to define routes of your application based on HTTP methods and URLs
    4. Includes various middleware modules which you can perform additional tasks on request nd response
    5. Easy to integrate with different template engines like Jade, EJS etc., 
    6. Allows you to define an Error Handling middleware
    7. Easy to serve Static Files and resources of your application
    8. Allows you to create REST API server
    9. Easy to connect with databases such as MongoDb, Redis, MySql

-> Define Routes:
    - use 'app' object to define different routes of your application.
    - the 'app' object includes get(), post(), put(), and delete() methods to define routes for HTTP GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests respectively.

-> Handle POST Request:
    - to handle the POST Request, you need to create a form: index.html
    - when you are working with form data, then you have to discus about 'Body Parser'
    - Body Parser: to handle HTTP POST request in Express, we have to install the middleware - body-parser 
    - the middleware was a part of Express earlier, 
    - the 'body-parser module parses the JSON, buffer, string, and url encoded data submitted using HTTP POST request. 
    - npm install body-parser

-> Serving static resources in NodeJs
    - It is easy to serve static files using builtin middleware in ExpressJs called 'express.static'
    - using express.static() method we can serve the static resources directly by specifying the folder name where you have store the static resources
